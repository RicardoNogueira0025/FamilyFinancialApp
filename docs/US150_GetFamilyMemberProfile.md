# US150 Get Family Member Profile Information
=======================================


# 1. Requirements

*As a family member, I want to get my profileâ€™s information*


**Demo1** As a family member, I want to get...

- Demo1.1. My family member profile information

We interpreted this requirement as the function of a user to receive their personal profile information.

- A MemberProfile needs to have the following information:
    - Name;
    - Birth Date;
    - Phone Number(none or multiple);
    - Email (none or multiple);
    - VAT Number;
    - Address;
    - Relation with Administrator(none or one);
    - If member is administrator.

# 2. Analysis

In order to fulfill this requirement, we need two main data pieces:
- Family ID of the actor's family
- Family Member ID of the actor's profile

At a later iteration, both the family ID and the family member's ID would be acquired through the Log In information. For this sprint, the IDs will have to be inputted.

This User Story is highly reliant on both the Family and FamilyMember classes, particularly the last one. A DTO approach was chosen to encapsulate the required information, as well as to provide more control over which member information is transmitted.



# 3. Design

The main process to fulfill this requirement would require the actor to select they want to add an email in the UI, which would then prompt the retrieval of their familyMemberID and familyID. In lieu of not having an UI, the Int *familyMemberID* and *familyID* will be directly inputed into the GetFamilyMemberProfileController.

## 3.1. Functionality Use
The GetFamilyMemberProfileController will invoke the Application object, which stores the FamilyService object. The Application will return the FamilyService to the Controller, and the getMemberProfile method is called to retrieve the Profile as a MemberProfileDTO object, using the familyID and familyMemberID. The Family is retrieve in the FamilyService instantiation and Family Member is then retrieved from the corresponding family.
The Family Member the uses the method createProfile to generate a new object of the type MemberProfileDTO, which is then returned to the FamilyService and then to the Controller.



## 3.2. Class Diagram
The main Classes involved are:
- GetFamilyMemberProfileController
- Application
- FamilyService
- Family
- FamilyMember
- MemberProfileDTO
- CCNumber

## 3.3. Applied Patterns
We applied the principles of Controller, Information Expert, Creator and PureFabrication from the GRASP pattern.
We also used the SOLID SRP principle.

## 3.4. Tests 

The tests were conducted on FamilyMemberTest, FamilyServiceTest and GetFamilyMemberProfileControllerTest. 
The following preparation was made for the execution of the tests:

    //Family Member Diogo
    String cc = "000000000ZZ4";
    String name = "Diogo";
    Date date = new Date(1990,8,26);
    Integer numero = 919999999;
    String email = "josediogoccbr@gmail.com";
    int nif = 212122233;
    String rua = "Rua Nossa";
    String codPostal = "4444-555";
    String local = "Zinde";
    String city = "Porto";
    String relacao = "filho";
    Relation relation = new Relation(relacao);
    boolean admin = false;

    Address address = new Address(rua, codPostal, local, city);
    EmailAddress emailAddress = new EmailAddress(email);
    List<EmailAddress> emails = new ArrayList<>();
    PhoneNumber phoneNumber = new PhoneNumber(numero);
    List<PhoneNumber> phoneNumbers = new ArrayList<>();
    VatNumber vatNumber = new VatNumber(nif);

    //Family Member Tony
    String id2 = "166699209ZY8";
    String name2 = "Tony";
    Date date2 = new Date(1954,8,26);
    int numero2 = 919999998;
    String email2 = "tony@gmail.com";
    int nif2 = 212122000;
    String rua2 = "Rua";
    String codPostal2 = "4444-556";
    String local2 = "Gaia";
    String city2 = "Porto";
    String relacao2 = "primo";
    Relation relation2 = new Relation(relacao2);
    boolean admin2 = false;

    FamilyMember diogo = new FamilyMember(cc, name, date,numero,email,nif,rua,codPostal,local, city, admin);
    FamilyMember jorge = new FamilyMember(id2, name2, date2, numero2, email2, nif2, rua2, codPostal2, local2, city2, admin2);
    FamilyMember diogoNoAdmin = new FamilyMember(cc, name, date,numero,email,nif,rua,codPostal,local, city);
    Family family = new Family(familyOneName, familyOneID);
    Family familyTwo = new Family(familyTwoName, familyTwoID);

**Test 1:** Verify that createProfile() creates the MemberProfileDTO correctly

    @Test
    void getMemberProfileTest1_objectsAreEqual() {
        emails.add(emailAddress);
        phoneNumbers.add(phoneNumber);
        MemberProfileDTO expected = new MemberProfileDTO(name, date, phoneNumbers, emails, vatNumber, address, admin);

        MemberProfileDTO result = diogoNoAdmin.createProfile();

        assertEquals(expected, result);
        assertNotSame(expected, result);
    }

**Test 2:** Verify that MemberProfileDTO is created if admin attribute is true

      @Test
      void getMemberProfileTest3_AdministratorObjectsAreEqual() {
  
          emails.add(emailAddress);
          phoneNumbers.add(phoneNumber);
          FamilyMember admin = new FamilyMember(cc, name, date,numero,email,nif,rua,codPostal,local, city, true);
          MemberProfileDTO expected = new MemberProfileDTO(name, date, phoneNumbers, emails, vatNumber, address, true);
  
          MemberProfileDTO result = admin.createProfile();
          //Assert
          assertEquals(expected, result);
          assertNotSame(expected, result);
      }

**Test 3:** Verify that MemberProfileDTO is created if an invalid email is provided

    @Test
    void getMemberProfileTest5_objectsAreEqualNullEmail() {
        phoneNumbers.add(phoneNumber);
        FamilyMember joaquim = new FamilyMember(cc, name, date,numero,null,nif,rua,codPostal,local, city);
        MemberProfileDTO expected = new MemberProfileDTO(name, date, phoneNumbers, emails, vatNumber, address, admin);

        MemberProfileDTO result = joaquim.createProfile();

        assertEquals(expected, result);
        assertNotSame(expected, result);
    }

**Test 4:** Verify that MemberProfileDTO is created if an invalid phoneNumber is provided

    @Test
    void getMemberProfileTest7_objectsAreEqualInvalidPhoneNumber() {
        emails.add(emailAddress);
        FamilyMember joaquim = new FamilyMember(cc, name, date,null,email,nif,rua,codPostal,local, city);
        MemberProfileDTO expected = new MemberProfileDTO(name, date, phoneNumbers, emails, vatNumber, address, admin);

        MemberProfileDTO result = joaquim.createProfile();

        assertEquals(expected, result);
        assertNotSame(expected, result);
    }

**Test 5:** Verify that getMemberProfile(familyID, ccNumber) creates MemberProfileDTO

    @Test
    void getFamilyMemberProfileUsingIDsTest1_MemberProfileDTOIsEquals() {
        emails.add(emailAddress);
        phoneNumbers.add(phoneNumber);
        familyService.addFamily(family);
        family.addFamilyMember(diogo);

        MemberProfileDTO expected = new MemberProfileDTO(name, date, phoneNumbers, emails, vatNumber, address, admin);

        MemberProfileDTO result = familyService.getFamilyMemberProfile(familyOneID, diogo.getID());

        assertEquals(expected, result);
        assertNotSame(expected, result);
    }

**Test 6:** Verify that getMemberProfile(ccNumber) in Family creates MemberProfileDTO

    @Test
    void getFamilyMemberProfileUsingIDsTest1_MemberProfileDTOIsEquals() {
        emails.add(emailAddress);
        phoneNumbers.add(phoneNumber);
        familyService.addFamily(family);
        family.addFamilyMember(diogo);
        MemberProfileDTO expected = new MemberProfileDTO(name, date, phoneNumbers, emails, vatNumber, address, admin);

        MemberProfileDTO result = family.getFamilyMemberProfile(diogo.getID());

        assertEquals(expected, result);
        assertNotSame(expected, result);
    }

**Test 7:** Verify that controller can create MemberProfileDTO, testing the whole flow

    @Test
    void getFamilyMemberProfileUsingIDsTest1_MemberProfileDTOIsEqual() {
        emails.add(emailAddress);
        phoneNumbers.add(phoneNumber);
        app.getFamilyService().addFamily(family);
        app.getFamilyService().getFamily(familyOneID).addFamilyMember(diogo);
        MemberProfileDTO expected = new MemberProfileDTO(name, date, phoneNumbers, emails, vatNumber, address, admin);

        MemberProfileDTO result = controller.getMemberProfile(familyOneID, diogo.getID());

        assertEquals(expected, result);
        assertNotSame(expected, result);
    }

# 4. Implementation

**Finding the correct FamilyService**

In order to find the relevant FamilyMember by its ID, a method was constructed to retrieve their index in the FamilyMember array in the Family Class:

    private int findFamilyMemberIndexByID(int familyMemberID){
        int index = 0;
        for (FamilyMember member : this.family) {
            if (member.getID() == familyMemberID) {
            return index;
            }
            index++;
        }
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("No family member with that ID was found");
    }

Following that, we can use it to retrieve the correct FamilyMember object:

    public boolean addEmail(String emailToAdd, int familyMemberID) {
        return family.get(findFamilyMemberIndexByID(familyMemberID)).addEmail(emailToAdd);
    }

**Creating and Adding the EmailAddress Object**

In the FamilyMember Class, we must first check if the email to add is already present in the EmailAddress array list. For that, the following method is used:

    private boolean isEmailAlreadyPresent(String emailToCheck){
        for (EmailAddress email : emails) {
            if (email.getEmail().equalsIgnoreCase(emailToCheck)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
        }

So we can now create and add the EmailAddress object to the array list (emails):

    public boolean addEmail(String emailToAdd) {
        if (!isEmailAlreadyPresent(emailToAdd)) {
            EmailAddress newEmail = new EmailAddress(emailToAdd);
            emails.add(newEmail);
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

# 5. Integration/Demonstration

As of this sprint, this function has no integration with other functions.

# 6. Observations

In the future, the Family Member ID would ideally have to be retrieved by a method that checks the log in info of the current user, instead of the ID being manually inputted.
